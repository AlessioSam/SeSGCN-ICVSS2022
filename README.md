<p>
A new Separable-Sparse Graph Convolutional Network (SeS-GCN) for pose forecasting is proposed. SeS-GCN bottlenecks the interaction of the spatial, temporal and channel-wise dimensions in GCNs. It learns sparse adjacency matrices by a teacher-student framework. SeS-GCN improves the SoA in human pose forecasting by 3.6\% on Human3.6M and it achieves the best performance in CHICO. It reaches an average error of 53.0mm with a run time of 2.3msec, enabling cobots to be aware of human operators.
